     - ***git pull*** : Fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.
     - ***git push*** : Pushes all local branch commits to the remote repository.
   -  Undo
      -  ***git revert [commit]*** : Creates a new commit that undoes all of the changes made in a specified commit.
      -  ***git reset [file]*** : Unstages the file, but preserves its contents.
      -  ***git reset [commit]*** : Resets your HEAD pointer to a previous commit and discards all changes since that commit.
